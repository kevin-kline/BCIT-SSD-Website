            <h2>Program Description</h2>
            <p>
                    The Software Systems Developer (SSD) program (Web Programmer option) is an eight month, 
                    full-time business application development program offered by BCIT's School of Computing and
                     Academic Studies, within the HTP department at the downtown Vancouver campus.
                    It prepares individuals for high-demand careers in the technical areas of web application
                     development, programming, database and systems analysis. Students learn industry-ready skills
                      through extensive hands-on practice in current scripting and coding techniques, object-oriented
                       architecture patterns, application security and scalability, developer tools, and platforms for
                        building complete web-based business applications from scratch.<br><br>
                    
                    Graduates of this certificate program may apply for acceptance into the BCIT Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems (additional prerequisites are required).
                    This program is delivered through classroom instruction, hands-on lab work and individual and team projects.
                    While applicants are not required to have formal computer programming experience, they need to have a solid understanding of object oriented programming as well as possess sound logical and reasoning skills. Applicants with no knowledge are advised to take a programming language course, such as introduction to object-oriented programming, C#, or Java.
