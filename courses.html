        <h2>SSDP 1501 Systems Foundations 1</h2>
        <p>SSDP 1501 provides a broad introduction to the software development life cycle for the web.<br> Common systems analysis
            and design models, including UML, are examined using case studies.<br> Professional looking, device responsive
            and valid client-side web scripting is introduced <br> with current and cross-browser compliant HTML. A comprehensive
            study in object-oriented programming<br> fundamentals is delivered through exercises and projects using C#. Lab
            exercises and projects combine<br> technical skills while also emphasising communication and presentation skills
            needed in a developer team<br> setting.
        </p>

        <h2>SSDP 2501 Systems Foundations 2</h2>
        <p>This course examines effective hardware and software architectures for web development<br> while also introducing
            object-oriented server-side programming. Labs and projects require<br> assembly and use of development platforms
            for web development. Students write advanced HTML<br> and CSS for the client combined with Java for device responsive
            server-side deployment.</p>
        <h2>SSDP 3501 Systems Foundations 3</h2>
        <p>SSDP 3501 introduces dynamic data-driven web development using both .NET and freeware platforms<br> and tools. Industry
            accepted relational database design and SQL coding are practiced using Microsoft<br> SQL Server and MySQL. Exercises
            and projects combine database development with scripting and code<br> including HTML, Javascript, PHP, and C#
            with ASP.NET for web application development.</p>


        <h2>SSDP 4001 Specialty Topics</h2>
        <p>Topics in this course round out knowledge gained in prior courses for building web applications<br> that have all
            the standard features of typical subscriber-access or point-of-sale web solutions.<br> At the end of this course,
            students are expected to be able to design and build intuitive, device<br> responsive, safe, secure, scalable,
            and robust commercial applications. As well, this course <br> emphasizes tool and platform selection for effective
            team development. Techniques for testing<br> and scaling applications are examined. Development patterns using
            web forms and the model view<br> controller frameworks are practiced. Course work also emphasizes interview and
            presentation skills<br> for effective project stakeholder communication.
        </p>
        <h2>SSDP 5001 Projects</h2>
        <p>This course integrates all soft and technical skills covered during the program through work in two<br> major team
            projects. Both projects challenge participants to research and assemble new technologies.<br> The first project
            is an internal project to design and build a data-driven commercial web site. <br> The second project involves
            a four-week term with an industry client to build a web site or web site<br> component. Both projects require
            agile systems analysis and design, project planning and management,<br> communication of design and progress,
            professional presentation, and data driven website development <br> using current best practices.
